# Weather-Dashboard
Using the open weatherapi, I created a web page that allows the user to search for a location and return its current weather conditions using an API, a seperate API is used to return the UV index. Another API is used to show the 5 day forecast.
Local storage is also used to save previous searches, these are only saved if a location returns a result (is a valid location).
Javascript is utilised with Jquery to manipulate the DOM.
